{"name":"OnCallAssignments","tagline":"A program for managing on-call assignments for health-care students.","body":"# OnCallAssignments\r\nThis is a web-based program to manage an \"on-call\" assignment for health-care students.\r\n\r\n### Scenario\r\nStudents are told that they are \"on-call\" for a certain span of hours.  During that time, they must monitor a Twitter feed.  At random times during the on-call period, the faculty member tweets the URL of a webpage containing a \"consult\".  Each student then has an hour to \r\n- Review the consult\r\n- Formulate a recommendation \r\n- Phone in the recommendation to a telephone number provided in the tweet\r\n\r\nWhen the student calls the telephone number, they are greeted by a message saying something along the lines of \r\n \r\n_Thanks for calling me back.  What do you think we should do with this patient?_\r\n \r\nThe students then have two minutes to explain their recommendation.  They press a key on the phone to indicate they are finished talking.   The voice thanks them for their advice and hangs up.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes the student receives a text message (SMS) on their phone with a link to a recording of the the response they just left.  This SMS confirms to the student that their response was received and recorded.  If the student has an email on file that is associated with the caller ID of their phone, they will also be emailed the link.\r\n\r\nFaculty can then go through the responses left by the students and score them on communications skills, clinical reasoning, professionalism, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n![ScreenShot.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtheilman/OnCallAssignments/master/media/ScreenShot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional features:\r\n- Host the application for free by following the instructions below.\r\n- Generate a web page for the \"consult\" from within the application. Track the number of \"hits\" on the page in real-time.\r\n- You can also generate a webpage for the key/rubric to give to the students after the consult is graded.\r\n- The program doesn't send the tweet.   However, it will generate a \"draft tweet\" that you can cut and paste into the Twitter website, an email, a Blackboard Announcement, or whatever method by which you choose to disseminate the consult request.\r\n- Specify the message students hear when they call the phone number and the message they hear after they are done leaving their consult.\r\n- Choose from different voices for the messages\r\n- Multiple consult requests can be in play at the same time by purchasing additional phone numbers from Twilio (currently $1 per month).\r\n- Specify the maximum amount of time students have to record their responses (encourage them to be concise).\r\n- Set different permission levels for administrators and for those who just need to grade student responses\r\n- Application is automatically set to use [Mailgun's](http://www.mailgun.com) free email service.   Alternatively, you can route emails through your own provider.\r\n- Program will attempt to generate \"shortened URLs\" for links to consult pages and recordings of student responses.\r\n- Import and export students in CSV format\r\n- Export consult responses in CSV format\r\n- Program attempts to guess which student left the response based on their phone number (helpful if the student mumbles or fails to leave their name).\r\n- Sort tables on different columns.  Search tables for specific information.\r\n- Transcribe the recording (extra fee charged by Twilio, currently 5 cents per minute)\r\n- Look up the person registered to an incoming cell phone number (extra fee charged by Twilio, current 1 cent per lookup)\r\n- Source code is available and editable.  Personalize the program for your own needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technical Details\r\n\r\nThe application uses [Twilio](http://www.Twilio.com) as a backend for the voice recording and text messages.   The faculty member has to have their own Twilio account and is responsible for whatever [charges](https://www.twilio.com/pricing) are incurred.   I estimate that running an assignment like the one above with a class of 100 students would cost between $3.00 - $5.00.\r\n\r\nI do not have any financial interest in Twilio.  For sake of disclosure, some of the other providers of similar services are [Tropo](https://www.tropo.com/), [Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/), and [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/).    Fork requests from persons wishing to adapt this software for use with other company's backends are welcome.\r\n\r\n![process.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtheilman/OnCallAssignments/master/media/Process.png)\r\n \r\nThe program is written in JavaScript using Bootstrap and the Meteor framework.   Meteor was chosen to allow for simple deployment by faculty members with little programming experience.   \r\n\r\nMeteor lends itself well to deployment using a [Platform as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (Paas) provider.  These are services where the server itself is managed by the company and the user is simply responsible for uploading and maintaining the application running on it. \r\n\r\nDeploying to [Meteor's own hosting service](https://www.meteor.com/try/6)   is the simplest option (and it is free!).  However, \"for pay\" options such as [Modulus](http://help.modulus.io/customer/portal/articles/1647770-using-meteor-with-modulus), [Heroku](https://github.com/jordansissel/heroku-buildpack-meteor) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-meteor-js-application-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-nginx) provide additional capabilities.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nIf you are a faculty member at an accredited health-care education school and would like assistance setting this up for your institution, please feel free to contact me.   \r\n\r\nInstallation does involve some use of the command line.  If you have no idea what \"ls\", \"sudo\" or \"mkdir\" mean, it might be best to get someone to help you.  But, if you are feeling adventurous, go ahead and follow the instructions below.\r\n\r\n**Step 1** Sign up for a [Meteor account](https://www.meteor.com/)\r\n\r\nIt may not be immediately obvious, but to create an account you first click on the \"Sign In\" button on the Meteor website.  Then you will be given the opportunity to create a new account.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Install Meteor on your local Windows, Mac or Linux computer.\r\n\r\nThe official instructions are [here](https://www.meteor.com/install), but you also might find these [unofficial instructions](http://meteortips.com/first-meteor-tutorial/getting-started/)  helpful.   \r\n\r\n_Windows:_   The Windows installation process is pretty similar to what you see with installing other Windows programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mac:_  The Mac installer requires that you use [Terminal](http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal).   You can [find the icon to open Terminal](http://www.wikihow.com/Open-Applications-Using-Terminal-on-Mac) in your Applications/Utilities folder.  Once you have Terminal open, cut and paste [the command](https://www.meteor.com/install) from the Meteor website into the Terminal window.  Then press <code>return</code>.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can skip the \"demo application\" that Meteor asks you to create.\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**  Download the application files to your local computer\r\n\r\nGo to the [releases page](https://github.com/gtheilman/OnCallAssignments/releases) to obtain the most recent version of the application.   Download the zip file.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Mac, it will probably unzip the folder for you automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you have Windows, you'll need to unzip the folder yourself.\r\n\r\n**Step 4:**  Run the application locally at least once.  \r\n\r\nThis involves going into Terminal (or Windows command prompt) and changing to the directory containing the Meteor files.  It can sometimes be difficult to figure out the path to the files you just downloaded.  Here's a way of doing it that might be easiest:\r\n\r\n \r\n1.  Go back to the Terminal  (or [Windows command prompt](Open the [command prompt](http://www.7tutorials.com/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8) )).\r\n\r\n2. From the command prompt, type <code>cd </code>.   That's the letter \"c\" , the letter \"d\" and a space.  Don't hit return yet.\r\n\r\n3. From with Windows _File Manager_ (or OSX _Finder_) locate the folder with the files you just downloaded and unzipped.  It probably starts with \"OnCallAssignments-\".  Don't move it from its original location.\r\n\r\n4. [Drag](http://osxdaily.com/2009/11/23/copy-a-files-path-to-the-terminal-by-dragging-and-dropping/) the folder _name_ with little folder icon in front of it into the Terminal/command prompt window.   You are not selecting a bunch of files, but just that one line with the folder name.  Make sure you choose the folder immediately above the collection of files.\r\n\r\n![folders.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtheilman/OnCallAssignments/master/media/folders.jpg) \r\n \r\nDrop it anywhere in the Terminal/command prompt window.\r\n\r\nClick with your mouse anywhere in the Terminal/command prompt window.  Now press the <code>Enter/return</code> key.\r\n\r\nType the word <code>meteor</code> in the Terminal window.   Press the <code>Enter/return</code> key.  It will take a few minutes for the installation process to complete.\r\n\r\nThe program is now running on your local computer.    You can access it by pointing your web browser at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 5:**  Deploy the application\r\n\r\nWhile you can open the application in a web browser while it is running on your local computer, you'll likely have problems interacting with Twilio if your program is not accessible to the outside world.   So, we're going to stop the program on your local computer by holding down the <code>Ctrl</code> (or <code>control</code>) key and tapping <code>c</code> twice\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are going to [install your application]  (http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/quickstart)  on Meteor's free hosting service to try it out for real.  \r\n\r\nThink of a unique one-word name for the application. Suppose you decide to call it <code>foo</code>.\r\n\r\nFrom the command prompt (or Terminal) type <code>meteor deploy foo </code> (or whatever name you chose).    Press the <code>Enter/return</code> key.\r\n\r\nYou will likely be asked for your Meteor username and password during this process.   When you type your password, it won't look like anything is happening on the screen.  Don't worry, it _is_ being entered.  Type your password, then press the <code>Enter/return</code> key.\r\n\r\nAfter you successfully deploy to Meteor, a URL where your application can be accessed will be displayed in the Terminal/command prompt window.  It will very likely be something like <code>http://foo.meteor.com</code>.  Make a note of it.\r\n\r\nOnce your application is up and running, you can delete the folder containing the files you downloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:**  Deploying to Meteor.com is a free service, so it's not really fair to complain when it slows down or stops working.   However, I have noticed that on occasion that it slows down or stops working.   While I think Meteor.com is a fine way of trying out the software to see if you like it, I'd suggest hosting on a \"pay\" site like [Modulus](http://help.modulus.io/customer/portal/articles/1647770-using-meteor-with-modulus) if you are planning on using this for actual assignments.   It's not that expensive and you can turn the program off between assignments to save money. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Initial Use\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** Open the application in your web browser using the provided URL  \r\n\r\nWhen the application is initially set up, the _login | password_  is _admin | admin_.   Change the admin password right away by clicking on the word _admin_ in the manu.  **Make sure you also provide a real email address**.  The only way to recover a password is by requesting that the application send a password reset link by email.   If you forget your password and have not provided a recovery email address, you are locked out of the application.  You change the admin email address by clicking on the _Faculty_ menu item and then _View/Edit/Delete_. \r\n\r\n**Step 2:**  Sign up for a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/)\r\n\r\nThe Twilio website walks you through the process of obtaining a phone number, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR5sAZUlx_0) might also help.  At this point, you don't need to provide Twilio a credit card.  The phone number used in the demo account is limited, but sufficient for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**  Enter your Twilio credentials into the application.\r\n\r\nThese are the AccountSID and AuthToken associated with your Twilio account.  They can be accessed in your account settings on the Twilio website.  Copy and paste these into the \"Credentials\" page in the application.\r\n\r\n**Step 4:**  Click on the _Consults_ menu item and call the Twilio phone number listed there.  If you have not given Twilio a credit card number, make sure you call from a cell phone that you have \"validated\" with Twilio.    That's fine if you are just testing the application.\r\n\r\nYou'll first hear the \"nag\" message telling you to upgrade.  Press a key and you will hear the actual prompt for the consult.   Leave a message, then press any key on the cell phone to finish.\r\n\r\nWithin a few seconds you should get a text message with a link to the recording.\r\n\r\n**Step 5:**  Review the response within the application by clicking on _Edit/View/Grade_ from within the _Consults_ page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Uses\r\n\r\nThis software might be useful for any situation where you might wish to record something a student is saying and have it reviewed/scored later.   \r\n*  Patient counseling exercises:   Call the Twilio number and put the cell phone on \"speakerphone\".    Have the student counsel the \"patient\".\r\n*  Practice having a pharmacy student call a \"pharmacy\" to request that a prescription be transferred.\r\n*  Calling a \"physician's office\" to clarify a prescription.\r\n\r\n###Notification of Use\r\n\r\n**If you use this software for a class, please send me an email letting me know.**  This is just so I can include some information on my faculty activity report regarding how the software is being used.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimers\r\n\r\nWhile not absolutely necessary to use the program, this application is designed to store  student information.  Some of that information (such as phone numbers) might fall under  [Federal rules](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) regarding  protecting student records.   While I have done my best to avoid situations which might expose private student information, I am making no guarantees as to data security.  You are responsible for reviewing the source code and making sure it meets the requirements of your institution.   If you are uncomfortable with adding student information to the application, **just don't add it**.   You can still have students phone in their responses, it's just that some of the features that involve matching students with responses won't work.\r\n\r\nI have not installed any \"backdoors\" that would allow me to access your installation of the application.   You can review the source code to see for yourself.   If you wish me to provide some sort of assistance once you have the application set-up, you would have to provide me with credentials to access your application.\r\n\r\nPlease review the software's license regarding lack of warranty and liability.    We are not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of your using this software.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
